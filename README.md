# Save-Your-Soul

Hi!

Thank you for downloading my Computer Science 30 final project!

I made this game using UPBGE (Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine), which is a sub program of the popular 3D modelling engine Blender.

This is intended to be simple and quick (5 miniutes of playtime)

After uploading, I will not be updating and minor bugs or errors. (You get what you get)

Although I believe there is minimal minor bugs (Physics issues, very minor)

After uploading, I will tackle a bigger project using Unity (A dedicated Game Engine)

I found Blender resources to be minimal, and want to tackle an even bigger game to make.

So! I have some links to the songs used in the game itself

**How To Download**

Since GitHub allows files of 25mb or less, I ddecided to use Mega instead

Please Navigate to https://mega.nz/file/dIIEXCTD#ChvdXIZW72o72x34DdAoP8URnmp4rLwKqlxNbYX4o1o and download Save Your Soul.zip

If you have a Mac computer or a 32-bit Windows computer, please download UPBGE from https://upbge.org/

**How To Run**

In order to run, please open the Blender Game Engine Folder

Navigate to the Blender.exe file and run it

Next click File -> Open -> Save Your Soul.blend

press P to play!

Anyways, Hope you have some fun playing Save Your Soul! :)
