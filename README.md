# Save-Your-Soul

Hi!

Thank you for downloading my Computer Science 30 final project!
I made this game using UPBGE (Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine), which is a sub program of the popular 3D modelling engine Blender.
This is intended to be simple and quick (5 miniutes of playtime)
After uploading, I will not be updating and minor bugs or errors. (You get what you get)
Although I believe there is minimal minor bugs (Physics issues, very minor)
After uploading, I will tackle a bigger project using Unity (A dedicated Game Engine)
I found Blender resources to be minimal, and want to tackle an even bigger game to make.

So! I have some links to the songs used in the game itself
